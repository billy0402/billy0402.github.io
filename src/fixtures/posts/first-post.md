I would like to write down some articles to record what I am learning.

Or I have faced in works.

Or I have faced in interviews.

Almost all the contents will be about computer science.

And also will have LeetCode's daily problem if I can solve it.

I use JavaScript and Python the most,

so most articles will focus on these programming languages.
